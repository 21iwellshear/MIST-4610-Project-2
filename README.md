Insights from this analysis are crucial for investors, policymakers, and potential homeowners looking to understand which markets are booming and which are more affordable

# Question 2
How have real estate sale prices and assessed values differed across various property types within the top 5 and bottom 5 cities for the last 5 years (2017-2021)? 
Relevance: This question examines the relationship between market-listed sale prices and government-assessed values across different property types in varying market conditions. Understanding these differences is crucial for assessing market valuation accuracy and identifying potential investment opportunities or risks.
Connection to Data: Requires the use of 'Property Type' to segment the analysis by the type of property, 'Assessed Value' and 'Sale Amount' to compare market values against assessed values, and 'Town' combined with 'List Year' to ensure the focus remains on the specific cities and time period of interest.
